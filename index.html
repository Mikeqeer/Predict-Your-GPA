        <h2>What Is GPA and Why Is It Important?</h2>
        <p>Your <strong>GPA (Grade Point Average)</strong> is a numerical value that represents the average of all your grades. Schools, colleges, and universities around the world use GPA to measure how well students perform across subjects during a semester or academic year.</p>

        <h3>Why Does GPA Matter?</h3>
        <p>A strong GPA is important because it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Helps you qualify for scholarships</li>
          <li>Improves your chances of getting into good colleges</li>
          <li>Helps you stay eligible for academic programs</li>
          <li>Builds confidence in your learning progress</li>
          <li>Helps you track your performance over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>GPA is not just a number—it reflects your consistency, dedication, and understanding of your subjects.</p>

        <h2>Why Predict Your GPA Before Exams?</h2>
        <p>Predicting your GPA before exams gives you valuable insights into your academic situation. Many students wait until the end of the semester to calculate their GPA, but this limits their ability to improve.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Predicting GPA Early</h3>
        <p>Here’s why predicting your GPA is useful:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You know where you stand before the final exams.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You understand which subjects need more attention.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You can set realistic goals for each exam.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You get a clear idea of the grades required to reach your target GPA.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>You can plan your study time more effectively.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you predict your GPA, you gain clarity, direction, and motivation. It becomes easier to create a study plan that leads to improved performance.</p>

        <h2>What Is a Grade Calculator and How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>grade calculator</strong> is a simple online tool that helps you estimate your GPA based on the grades you already have and the scores you expect to get in the upcoming exams.</p>

        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p>Most grade calculators require you to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter your current grades</li>
          <li>Add the weight of each assignment or exam</li>
          <li>Estimate your expected marks</li>
          <li>Get an instant projected GPA</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The results show how much each assignment, test, or exam contributes to your overall grade. It also helps you understand how much effort you need to put into the remaining assessments.</p>

        <h2>How to Predict Your GPA Before Exams: Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <p>Predicting your GPA is not difficult when you follow a clear process. Below is a simple step-by-step method students can use.</p>

        <div class="steps">
          <h3>Step 1: Gather All Your Current Grades</h3>
          <p>Before predicting your GPA, you need accurate information. Collect your grades for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quizzes</li>
            <li>Assignments</li>
            <li>Midterms</li>
            <li>Projects</li>
            <li>Class participation</li>
            <li>Any graded activity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Make sure you also know the <strong>weight</strong> of each grade. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Midterm = 30%</li>
            <li>Assignments = 20%</li>
            <li>Final exam = 40%</li>
            <li>Quizzes = 10%</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information is normally provided by instructors or written in your course outline.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Find the Weight of Your Final Exam</h3>
          <p>Your final exam usually carries the most weight. It may account for 30%, 40%, or even 50% of your total grade.</p>
          <p>Knowing the weight is important because it helps you understand how much the final exam will impact your GPA.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Use a Grade Calculation Tool</h3>
          <p>Now that you have your current grades and exam weights, enter them into the grade calculator. The tool will ask for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current grade percentage</li>
            <li>Remaining assignment or exam weight</li>
            <li>Expected score in the exam</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once you fill in the details, the calculator will show your predicted grade or GPA.</p>
          <p>You will also be able to test different scenarios, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“What if I score 80% on the final exam?”</li>
            <li>“What grade do I need to get a B or A?”</li>
            <li>“How much will my GPA change if I score above 90%?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This gives you a realistic idea of where you stand.</p>

          <h3>Step 4: Calculate Multiple Scenarios</h3>
          <p>Instead of predicting one single score, it is better to calculate multiple possibilities.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best-case scenario (90–100% on final)</li>
            <li>Average performance scenario (70–85%)</li>
            <li>Minimum passing scenario (50–60%)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By doing this, you will understand the full range of possible outcomes. It helps you know the minimum score you need to reach your target grade.</p>

          <h3>Step 5: Identify Weak Subjects</h3>
          <p>After predicting your GPA, you will have a clear idea of which subjects are affecting your final result.</p>
          <p>Ask yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which subjects are bringing down my GPA?</li>
            <li>Which final exams require more attention?</li>
            <li>Which subjects have high weightage?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This information lets you prioritize your study schedule.</p>

          <h3>Step 6: Adjust Your Study Plan</h3>
          <p>Once you know what grades you need to achieve your desired GPA, you can create a focused study plan.</p>
          <p>A good study plan includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Setting daily goals</li>
            <li>Spending more time on difficult subjects</li>
            <li>Practicing previous exam papers</li>
            <li>Taking mock tests</li>
            <li>Reviewing notes and textbooks</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Planning based on predicted GPA helps you stay on track and avoid last-minute panic.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips to Improve Your Predicted GPA</h2>
        <p>If your estimated GPA is lower than expected, don’t worry. You still have time to improve before the exams. Here are some useful tips:</p>

        <h3>1. Focus on High-Weight Assignments</h3>
        <p>Assignments or exams with high weight can change your GPA significantly. Give them maximum attention.</p>

        <h3>2. Improve Weak Areas</h3>
        <p>Identify the subjects or topics that are pulling your grades down and focus extra effort on them.</p>

        <h3>3. Create a Study Checklist</h3>
        <p>A checklist ensures you complete all important tasks before exams.</p>

        <h3>4. Avoid Cramming</h3>
        <p>Study regularly rather than leaving everything for the last week.</p>

        <h3>5. Ask for Help</h3>
        <p>If you don’t understand something, ask a teacher or friend for clarification.</p>

        <h3>6. Practice Past Papers</h3>
        <p>Past papers help you understand exam format and improve confidence.</p>

        <h3>7. Stay Consistent</h3>
        <p>Small, daily study habits can significantly improve your final GPA.</p>

        <h2>List of Things You Need Before Predicting GPA</h2>
        <p>Here are some items you should have ready:</p>
        <ul>
